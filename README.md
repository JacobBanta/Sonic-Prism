# Sonic-Prism
This is a game i guess. controls are w,a,s,d,space,and shift(for now). a and d are normal left and right movement. space is for jumping. if you hold s you will crouch down. if you start moving while crouching, you will go into a roll. if you hold w you will look up. if you jump while looking up, you can jump higher.
pressing shift will cancel all velocity. this is more for testing than a game design choice

# Level Builder
You use the level builder to make levels. You can simply click two points to make a box between them. You use the alt key to save the level. You can use the ctrl key to load the last save. You can also use shift to clear the level.
