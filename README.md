This is a game i guess. controls are w,a,s,d,space,and shift(for now). a and d are normal left and right movement. space is for jumping. if you hold s you will crouch down. if you start moving while crouching, you will go into a roll. if you hold w you will look up. if you jump while looking up, you can jump higher.
pressing shift will cancel all velocity. this is more for testing than a game design choice
